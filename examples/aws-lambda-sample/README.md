# Raygun + AWS Lambda Example

This is a sample AWS Lambda function to show how to use Raygun4Node and AWS Lambda together.

This example uses the local `raygun` and `@raygun/aws-lambda` packages in this project repository by simply pointing to the directories as a dependency in package.json:

```
"raygun": "file:../..",
"@raygun/aws-lambda": "file:../../aws-lambda"
```

## Prepare package

Run the `prepare.sh` script.

This script installs the dependencies, builds the example, and packages it in the `example.zip` file.

## Deploy

To run this example, you have to create first an AWS Lambda function.

Follow the instructions in AWS' website: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/getting-started.html

Once your function is ready, use the "Upload from" to upload the generated `example.zip` file.

## Example setup

Before running the example, you have to complete the following setup.

1. Add `RAYGUN` environment variable with your API key.
2. Add `DEBUG` environment variable with the value `raygun` to see detailed logs.

3. Create a new event with the following content:

## Run the sample

Finally, select the newly created event and click the "Test" button.

You should see execution results similar to these:

```

{
  "errorType": "string",
  "errorMessage": "AWS Error from callback!",
  "trace": []
}
